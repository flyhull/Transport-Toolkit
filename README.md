This INCOMPLETE repo provides components needed to build a communications network to allow users who have a set of common pre-shared keys to communicate:

b) without identifying themselves to each other and
c) without the network traffic linking them to each other

Since Signalr is used as the transport layer for encrypted messages embedded in PNG images, the largest practical plaintext message size is 8K.
